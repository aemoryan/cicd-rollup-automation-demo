# cicd-rollup-automation-demo
A 2-week sprint project demonstrating automated version roll-ups, tagging, and branch management in a CICD environment. Designed to reduce manual release management overhead for small data-engineering or analytics teams.

Most small analytics teams do not need a $10k-a-month CI/CD footprint. They need a lightweight, auditable, serverless system that automates releases and keeps environments consistent.

This repo demonstrates how to implement real CI/CD principles (integration, delivery, versioning, and promotion) using AWS Lambda, GitLab, and lightweight Python automation. No runners, no Kubernetes, no fuss.

It's a CI/CD for the 90%: Cheap, simple, and scalable.
